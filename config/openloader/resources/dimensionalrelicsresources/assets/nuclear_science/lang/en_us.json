The longer it runs in an overheated state, the greater the risk of meltdown becomes. Also, the hotter a reactor runs, the quicker the fuel source degrades! When a fuel rod is expended, it will leave behind a Spent Fuel Rod which can be processed into other valuable materials.",

Each salt pellet melts to %s mB, and the core has an internal capacity of 1000 mB. The salt is slowly consumed over time and produces waste which is also collected by the supplier.

To effectively do this, it must be placed in a 5x5x2 pool of water, and must be water-logged to function. The easiest way to do this is to fill the pool and then place the Exchanger.

If the Particle and Booster are facing the same direction, the Booster will increase the Particle's speed by 0.33% for every tick the Particle is inside the Booster. If the Booster is a corner, it will increase the Particle's speed by 0.17% for every tick the Particle is inside the Booster. This means that the faster a Particle moves, the less effective each successive Booster becomes. It is important to note that moving particles emit radiation.",

To make one a corner variant, stand on top of Booster segment you wish to turn, and place a Booster to start the next segment after the corner. Looking at the outter bottom corner of the next segment's Booster, place the corner Booster. If you did it properly, you will not be able to directly see the inside of Booster.",
